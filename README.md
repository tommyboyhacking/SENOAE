Hi Friends, 

For those of us who long for simpler times...

The SENOAE system comes action-less packed!

It just f****** searches.

Here's an example 


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71306171-9e50-4c5b-99f5-7ab4ba3806ae


Boom, searches

To get this set up on Firefox. just clone the repo as is, go to `about:debugging` in your Firefox browser, then load temporary add on and select any random file in the directory. 

It will disappear once Firefox is closed because it is not an official extension.
